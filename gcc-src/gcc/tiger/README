GCC Tiny Frontend
-----------------

This is an illustrative frontend for the Tiny Imperative Language (TIL)

The aim of this frontend is just to showcase how a front end can be implemented
in GCC. TIL is an extremely simple language. See the basic syntax in
tiny-basic-grammar.txt.

The interesting bits are all in <top-level>/gcc/tiny.

Goals:
  - be a front end example that can be understood and extended by a single developer

  Rationale: It may be tempting to attempt to start with other GCC frontends, but
    since they are production-grade their code is production-grade too, so it can
    be intimidating for newcomers.

Non-goals:

  - be production-grade
